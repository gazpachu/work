<font color="#666666">Our courses are monographic and focused on design and floral creation. They have two parts:<br>
- A theoretical one, in which we deal with some questions about the material we are going to work with (it will be provided by the organization) and the most innovative techniques.<br>
- A practical one, in which the student applies the acquired knowledge.</font><br><br>

<font color="#666666">In Roberto Silvosa Floristas, we have two types of courses (years):<br>
- The first one is directed at those persons who, without being specialists in the matter, are interested in the exciting world of the floral art; in this type of course we will teach to make small floral compositions (centers of table, vases …).<br>
- The second one is dedicated to those professionals who want to improve their skills; in this course, aspects like the high design, the recycling, the structures, the big dimensions will be treated.<br>
The number of students per course varies between 8 and 12 participants.</font><br>
<font color="#FF9933">Duration and certification</font><br>
<font color="#666666">There are two modalities for the duration of the courses:<br>
- The courses for amateurs, which vary between 12 hours (divided in 3 days) and 20 hours (divided in 4 days).<br>
- The ones dedicated to professionals, which last 35 hours (given in 5 days).<br>
Having finished the monographic one, a diploma will be conferred that specifies the type of course realized, the dates when they have been given and the total number of hours.</font><br>
