          <p class="style35" align="justify">The Spanish Chamber of Commerce in 
          the Philippines was established on July 16, 1899, shortly after the 
          American occupation of Manila. At that time, there was a substantial 
          Spanish community in the country, which actively participated in 
          industry, trade and commerce.</p>
          <p class="style35" align="justify">World War II dealt a very hard blow 
          to the Spanish community in the Philippines. Many Spaniards were 
          killed during the war, particularly during the liberation of Manila 
          and most of their business establishments and personal properties were 
          destroyed. As there were no damage claims paid to Spanish citizens (although 
          Japan eventually agreed to pay some compensation to Spaniards killed 
          during the war), Spanish businessmen, particularly the smallest ones, 
          found it difficult to rebuild after the war. In 1946, the Spanish 
          government offered to repatriate all Spanish citizens wishing to 
          return to Spain, many took advantage of this offer, thus reducing the 
          Spanish community to a fraction of what it had been before the war.</p>
          <p class="style35" align="justify">The activities of the Spanish 
          Chamber were able to continue with the help of the few remaining 
          Spanish companies in the Philippines, principally Compania General de 
          Tabacos de Filipinas (Tabacalera) and its subsidiaries, Roxas y Cia, 
          with its subsidiary, Central Azucarera de Don Pedro, as well as, 
          Filipino companies of Spanish origin such as San Miguel Corporation, 
          Elizalde &amp; Co., Inc. and others.</p>
          <p class="style35" align="justify">The early post war years were 
          difficult for trade between Spain and the Philippines. However, Spain 
          continued to be a very important market for tobacco and other 
          Philippine agricultural products while imports from Spain were limited 
          mostly to wines and canned food items.</p>
          <p class="style35" align="justify">Aware of the importance of 
          improving trade relations worldwide, the Spanish Government started to 
          subsidize the activities of the Spanish Chamber of Commerce in many 
          countries to allow these to expand their scope of work. Today, &quot;La 
          Camara&quot; is an organization focused in the promotion of the trade 
          between Spain and the Philippines and to help and participate in the 
          development of the Philippines.</td>
